## Summary

This is not about _using_ postscript.

This is about writing programs which are executed on a *PostScript interpreter*

PostScript is a pretty fun/cool/powerful programming language, it has a pretty intuitive stack-based virtual machine 
which runs on nearly all modern computers (and also oldfashioned Printers).

## Tips

There is a Postscript Syntax Highlighting extension for Visual Code! This makes reading / writing code much easier!
